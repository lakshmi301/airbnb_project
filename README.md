The goal is to extract meaningful business insights from the dataset and visualize them using Pythonâ€™s data analysis libraries.

## 2. Objectives

- To clean and prepare the Airbnb dataset for analysis.  
- To explore patterns in price, availability, and reviews.  
- To identify factors affecting Airbnb pricing.  
- To visualize data to support insights and findings.
